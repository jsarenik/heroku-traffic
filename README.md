# heroku-traffic

Script that parses logs from Heroku and computes the used
data bandwidth.

## Usage

Download `tsv.gz` log files from [PaperTrailApp archive](https://papertrailapp.com/account/archives)
to the directory containing this script. Run `compute.sh` and it
will output the number of bytes.

## License

Yes, you guessed it :-) It should have been rather a gist as the
license is much longer than the one-liner solving the problem.
